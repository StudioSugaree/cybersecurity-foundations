# Cybersecurity Foundations Portfolio

This repository documents my journey through core cybersecurity skills and certifications completed in preparation for Georgia Tech’s MS in Cybersecurity program (starting Jan 2026).

It contains hands-on labs, scripts, study notes, and implementation exercises across five domains:

- **Python scripting** – log parsing, CSV analysis, API calls.
- **Linux & Networking** – command-line practice, packet capture analysis.
- **Cloud Security** – AWS IAM least privilege implementation.
- **CompTIA Security+** – study notes and security frameworks.
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – mock ISMS implementation and risk register.

Each folder includes a local README with details on exercises, deliverables, and learning outcomes.
